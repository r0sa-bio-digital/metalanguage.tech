    <h2>Core idea</h2>
    <p>
      Metalanguage - is a single language for people of all nationalities and computers of all architectures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentence once written in metalanguage (metasentence) can be automatically translated to any natural language (like English, Hindi, Tamil, Russian, French etc) or to machine code for computer of any architecture (like x86, x64, ARM, RISC, VLIW etc).
    </p>
    <p>
      Metabooks, metasites and metaprogramms could be assembled from metasentences. This gives us completely new opportunities in global communications and management.
    </p>

    <h2>Why are we ready to do it now?</h2>
    <p>
      Metalanguage is not like any traditional natural language or even not like any programming language. Metalanguage is a complicated distributed digital service with constantly expanding semantic core.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we know, natural language is not a digital service. Programming language is a digital service, but it has predefined fixed semantic core.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our modern computing power and knowledge of computer science allow to start development of metalanguage. But it was impossible 30-40 years ago, when most of actual programming languages and paradigms were born.
    </p>

    <h2>Benefit for investor</h2>
    <p>
      Let's overcome the inertia of thinking and take advantage of the opportunities for the development of our civilization, which are provided to us by modern information technologies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Metalanguage foundation is a nonprofit organization by its nature. It is created to research and development core technologies neccessary for future commercial applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you become an investor of Metalanguage Foundation, then you will receive a priority right to participate in all subsequent commercial projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many well known projects, using the same model:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">The Linux Foundation</a> - Linux OS, RISC-V International, OpenAPI Initiative.</li>
        <li><a href="https://openjsf.org/">OpenJS Foundation</a> - Node.js, jQuery, webpack.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundaton</a> - Kubernetes.</li>
        <li><a href="https://ethereum.org/en/foundation/">Ethereum Foundation</a> - Ethereum Blockchain.</li>
        <li><a href="https://web3.foundation/">Web3 Foundation</a> - Polkadot Blockchain.</li>        
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fact 40 years ago that humanity will get global communication network in near future. And Internet was created in few years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is a fact that humanity will get Metalanguage in near future. The question is <i>Who will invest in Metalanguage on early stage and become a co-founder of a new digital era?</i>
